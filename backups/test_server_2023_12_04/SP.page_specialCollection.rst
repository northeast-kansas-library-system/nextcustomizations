<h2>Note from the Artist, Daniel Arrhakis</h2>
<p> The unthinkable happened this morning when Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine.
<br> <br>
My support to all Ukraine citizens and their families in entire World in these so sad and tragic times ...

 
<br> <br>
 

After having implemented for years an autocratic policy of absolute control of parliamentary, police, judicial and military institutions, he is now trying to subjugate Ukraine, threatening Europe as well.

 <br> <br>

His policy of repression was imposed mercilessly on the Russian people, not allowing any opposition or free press, repressing, murdering, illegalizing peaceful institutions, persecuting citizens or imprisoning all those who opposed him... the end result is this!

 <br> <br>


I repeat here the words of President of the European Commission Von der Leyen :

 <br> <br>

"Once again, in the center of Europe, innocent women, men and children are dying or fear for their lives. We condemn this barbaric attack, and the cynical arguments used to justify it".

 <br> <br>

But one thing is for sure, the rest of the world has finally woken up and will not let the values of Democracy and freedom be called into question by a bloodthirsty and unscrupulous dictator like Putin and the corrupt oligarchs who support him!

 <br> <br>

And believe me that those who believe in Freedom, Peace and Democracy are in the majority and are not afraid ... </p>
